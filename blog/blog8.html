    <h1>How to Conduct a Comprehensive SEO Audit</h1>
    <p>Conducting a comprehensive SEO audit is essential for identifying issues and opportunities that can improve your website’s search engine performance. This guide will walk you through the steps to perform a thorough SEO audit, ensuring your website is optimized for better rankings and increased traffic.</p>

    <h2>1. Analyze Your Website’s Performance</h2>
    <p>Start by evaluating your website's performance using tools like Google Analytics and Google Search Console. Look at metrics such as organic traffic, bounce rate, and conversion rates to understand how well your site is performing.</p>

    <h2>2. Check for Technical SEO Issues</h2>
    <p>Technical SEO involves optimizing your website's infrastructure. Use tools like Screaming Frog and SEMrush to identify issues such as broken links, duplicate content, and slow page load times. Ensure your site is mobile-friendly and has an SSL certificate for security.</p>

    <h2>3. Evaluate On-Page SEO Factors</h2>
    <p>On-page SEO focuses on optimizing individual pages for specific keywords. Check that each page has a unique title tag, meta description, and header tags. Ensure your content is high-quality, relevant, and includes targeted keywords naturally.</p>

    <h2>5. Review Your Content Strategy</h2>
    <p>Content is king in SEO. Ensure your content is valuable, engaging, and regularly updated. Use keyword research to identify content gaps and create new content that targets relevant keywords. Optimize existing content for better performance.</p>

    <h2>6. Monitor User Experience</h2>
